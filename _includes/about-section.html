                Computer science student in a double diploma at the INSA Rennes and the TU Dresden,
                I am a new-technology enthusiast. I started my studies at the French engineering school
                <em>INSA Rennes</em> in 2013. Last year I had the opportunity to finish my studies at the
                <em>Technische University of Dresden</em>, Germany. I am now looking for a company to 
                supervise my diplom thesis.

                During my studies and in personal projects, I was involved in website development,
                desktop application development, and Web API development. More generally, I like to be
                involved in dynamic projects. In my private life, I practice inline skating all year
                around and ice-hockey when the weather allows it.
