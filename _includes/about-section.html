                Working as a senior fullstack engineer at <em>Doctolib</em>, I am a new-technology enthusiast and committed to improving privacy. I started my studies at the French engineering school
                <em>INSA Rennes</em> in 2013. In 2016 I had the opportunity to pursue my studies at the
                <em>Technische University of Dresden</em>, Germany. I finished my studies in September 2018, and am now working for Doctolib.

                During my work, studies and personal projects, I like to be involved in both Front-End and Back-End development. I also have a good understanding of computer science security. I like to be involved in dynamic and privacy-focused projects.
