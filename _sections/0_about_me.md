Working as a senior fullstack engineer at *Doctolib*, I am a new-technology enthusiast and committed to
improving privacy. I started my studies at the French engineering school
*INSA Rennes* in 2013. In 2016 I had the opportunity to pursue my studies at the
*Technische University of Dresden*, Germany. I finished my studies in September 2018, and am now working for
Doctolib.
   
During my work, studies and personal projects, I like to be involved in both Front-End and Back-End development. I
also have a good understanding of computer science security. I like to be involved in dynamic and privacy-focused
projects.
