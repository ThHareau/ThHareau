Working as a Senior Fullstack Engineer at *Doctolib*, I am a new-technology enthusiast and committed to
improving privacy.
   
During my work, studies and personal projects, I like to be involved in both Front-End and Back-End development. I
also have a good understanding of computer science security. I like to be involved in dynamic and privacy-focused
projects.
